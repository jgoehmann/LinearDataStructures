# LinearDataStructures
1.Linked Lists allow a user to queue a list of items and pull from some point in the list, so that a program may follow a specific sequence without
effectively running through the full list, saving memory and processing power in the long run.
2.A stack adds an item to the stack, then pulls from the last item in the stack, while a queue will add an item from a queue and when an item is
requested pull from the first item that was entered into the queue
3. A stack might be used if, for one if something needs to be reversed but also if maybe for debugging you could keep work backwards to find where something went wrong
4. An array would likely be used if a program is dependent on a certain index or length of an item, making it harder to screw up the program upon collaboration efforts
or if you have a long list of variables of a certian data type and could declare it as an array isntead of 30 lines of defining variables
